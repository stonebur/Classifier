Please be sure that all of your python systems are up to date before trying this
Also make sure you are running this on a linux machine with up to date with tensorflow
This uses parts of python and potentially blends with python3 as this evolves so make sure both are up to date
When you know what images you would like to classify upload a folder with pictures of the directories respective name
(ie. if I wanted to categorize roses, call a folder roses and put pictures of roses within) inside of the tf_files/catvdog directory
By default this directory has a few flower folders, a chihuahua folder and a cat folder
Feel free to change these directories contents, this is what will train this software
Once all of these steps are taken care of, start the shell script by typing "./runclassifier.sh"
This will prompt you with questions, just follow the instructions and you should be good but if not hit me up
At this point all the annoying intermittent steps are done through shell scripts I wrote so lmk if you notice any bugs
Mess around and delete the current categories or add more and test it thoroughly, try to break it so we know if we need to fix anything
If you want to start adding to the repository I think it would be a great idea to start building a webscraper that pulls images from online by querying them through google images or another good image querying website.
Once we get that portion implemented we can start making and start thinking of even more powerful things we can apply this tool to
This is an incredibly powerful tool and it is surprisingly very accurate, there are many interesting things we can analyze and make decisions with
Please let me know if anyone has any ideas of how to apply this or cool directions we can go in
